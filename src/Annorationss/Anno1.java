    /*Classes, methods, variables, parameters and packages are allowed to be annotated.*/
    /*An annotation is a marker which associates information with a program construct, but has no effect at run time.*/
  /*  Annotations are used for a multitude of purposes. Frameworks like Spring and Spring-MVC make use of annotations
    to define where Dependencies should be injected or where requests should be routed.
    Other frameworks use annotations for code-generation. Lombok and JPA are prime examples,
    that use annotations to generate Java (and SQL) code.*/
